# Connect4CPT
The Final Culminating Task I made for my ICS4UE course

Hello!

So, everyone in my class was given the choice of a few different games we could create for our final project in our Grade 12 Computer Science course, and I chose to make Connect 4.
It was made using Java Swing.
The IDE used was NetBeans.
Although the AI system is still incomplete as their is only one difficulty, the game still functions as intended.
If you want to check out a more intricate AI system, you can check out my Tic Tac Toe Game.

Enjoy!
